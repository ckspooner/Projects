### Here's a recent Power BI dashboard I created comparing the Medicare charges and payments made by each state and hospital nationwide!

#### To create this visualization I utilized two datasets, the Medicare Inpatient dataset and the Providers dataset from the CMS official government website. I connect the two datasets by matching the Provider's Id so I was able to work with the data as a collective.
